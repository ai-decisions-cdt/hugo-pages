I am a Professor of Computational Medicine in the Department of Computer Science (FSE) and the Division of Informatics, Imaging and Data Science (FBMH) at The University of Manchester. I am also the Director of the Centre for Computational Imaging and Modelling in Medicine and the [Christabel Pankhurst Institute](https://www.pankhurst.manchester.ac.uk/). I am a Royal Academy of Engineering Chair in Emerging Technologies and a European Research Council Advance Grant holder.

I am on a mission to revolutionise the development of medical products and the decision-making process surrounding the R&D and regulation of medical devices, with a specific focus on cardiovascular, orthopaedic, and medical imaging devices. I am driven to enhance the scientific evidence used in device design and regulation, envisioning a future where our work significantly improves patient outcomes and healthcare efficiency. I also lead the InSilicoUK Network.

To achieve these ambitious goals, I believe in the power of interdisciplinary collaboration. Our landmark papers, listed below, are a testament to this. They reflect my interests in statistical models, deep representation/manifold learning, synthetic data and digital twins/chimeras, uncertainty quantification and design optimisation using deep learning, and the incorporation of knowledge priors (eg physics, physiology, etc) into learning systems. I look forward to the opportunity to work together on these exciting projects.
