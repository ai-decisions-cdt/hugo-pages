I am Associate Professor (Senior Lecturer) in Machine Learning in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Manchester. 

I am a member of the [Centre for AI Fundamentals](https://ai-fun.manchester.ac.uk/) and a supervisor in the [UKRI AI CDT in Decision Making for Complex Systems](https://www.ai-decisions-cdt.ac.uk/). I am also a member of the [European Laboratory for Learning and Intelligent Systems](https://ellis.eu/).

My research is on machine learning, theory and practice. That said, I tend to have a broad interest in various aspects of the mathematical and statistical foundations of machine learning and AI in general. In the limit of tending to praxis, I work on designing strategies to train and certify machine learning models. Previously, I have led or been a contributor to projects on offline reinforcement learning, generative models, PAC-Bayes bounds for deep learning and kernel classifiers, among other.

Further information about me and my work can be found in my [Personal Webpage](https://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/omar.rivasplata/).
