I'm a professor in the Computational and Biological Learning Lab in the Division of Information Engineering at the Department of Engineering in Cambridge. My research is in computational neuroscience. As more and more neural and behavioural data is being collected in increasingly complex settings, unique opportunities arise to study how brains control behaviours. A major challenge is to infer the computational and mechanistic principles underlying adaptive control from this ocean of data. My lab tackles this puzzle in two ways:

- by building network-level theories of brain computation, with an emphasis on motor control
- by developing machine learning methodology for analysing complex datasets in light of these theories

At both levels, our work builds heavily upon engineering-related domains such as dynamical systems and control theory, probabilistic machine learning, and optimization.
